# Teaching Statistics Demo

This project simulates a teaching dataset and walkthrough from a project-based undergraduate statistics course. It includes a small, readable script for basic analysis (t-tests, regression) using a simplified health dataset.

The goal is to demonstrate statistical reasoning and communication, not complex modeling.

## Objectives
- Demonstrate hypothesis testing and linear regression in an accessible, real-world context
- Show how to explain results clearly for non-technical learners
- Highlight applied biostatistics and teaching experience

## Tools
- R (or Python)
- Simulated CSV data
- Optional Jupyter Notebook or RMarkdown format

## Files Included
- `teaching_stats_demo.R` (or `.ipynb`)
- `simulated_health_data.csv`
